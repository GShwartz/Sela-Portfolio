### Usage

1. make sure that the port you want to use is free (no websites in IIS that runs on that port).
2. copy files to your web path.
3. navigate to the folder
4. run command: "dotnet webapp.dll"
5. open browser and surf to http://localhost:port

- to change the port you can edit the appsettings.json file.


### Troubleshooting

If dotnet command doesn't run at all you might need to download and install dotnet-hosting-6.0.5-win <br />
